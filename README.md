# In-Memory Todo API using fasthttp

This project implements a minimal REST API for managing todos. It is built with [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp) and uses inâ€‘memory storage for simplicity. The API supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos, along with handling optional file uploads for images and managing subtasks.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete todo items.
- **Subtask Support:** Each todo can have multiple subtasks. The todo is marked as completed when all its subtasks are completed.
- **File Uploads:** Supports multipart form-data file uploads for images, which are saved to a local `uploads` directory.
- **In-Memory Storage:** Todos are stored in memory, making this a lightweight example ideal for testing or prototyping.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.16 or later recommended)
- [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp) (v1.59 or later)

## Testing the API
You can test the API using Postman or similar API testing tools.

For example, to create a new todo in Postman:

Set the request method to POST and URL to http://localhost:8080/todos.

In the Body tab, select form-data.

Add keys for title, description, subtasks (enter a JSON array as text), and optionally images (set type to File and select one or more files).

Click Send and check the JSON response for the created todo.

Notes
Optional Images: The images field is optional. If no image files are uploaded, the todo will still be created with an empty images array.

In-Memory Storage: All data is stored in memory and will be lost when the server is restarted.

Uploads Directory: Uploaded files are saved in the uploads folder.
